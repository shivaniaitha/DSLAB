In array implementation, the stack is formed by using the array. All the operations regarding the stack are performed using arrays.
Adding an element onto the stack (push operation).
Stack is overflown when we try to insert an element into a completely filled stack therefore, our main function must always avoid stack overflow condition.
Deletion of an element from a stack (Pop operation).
The underflow condition occurs when we try to delete an element from an already empty stack.
Time Complexity for push and pop are O(1).
