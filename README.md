•	push(): When we insert an element in a stack then the operation is known as a push. If the stack is full then the overflow condition occurs.
•	pop(): When we delete an element from the stack, the operation is known as a pop. If the stack is empty means that no element exists in the stack, this state is known as an underflow state.
