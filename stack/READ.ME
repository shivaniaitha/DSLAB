A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle.
It contains only one pointer top pointer pointing to the topmost element of the stack.
Whenever an element is added in the stack, it is added on the top of the stack, and the element can be deleted only from the stack.
In other words, a stack can be defined as a container in which insertion and deletion can be done from the one end known as the top of the stack.
In array implementation, the stack is formed by using the array. All the operations regarding the stack are performed using arrays.
operations performed on stack are: 1.Adding an element onto the stack (push operation)
                                   2.Deletion of an element from a stack (Pop operation)
Stack is overflown when we try to insert an element into a completely filled stack therefore, our main function must always avoid stack overflow condition.
The underflow condition occurs when we try to delete an element from an already empty stack.
