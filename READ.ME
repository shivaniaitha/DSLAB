Linear search is also called as sequential search algorithm. It is the simplest searching algorithm. 
In Linear search, we simply traverse the list completely and match each element of the list with the item whose location is to be found.
If the match is found, then the location of the item is returned; otherwise, the algorithm returns NULL.
We iterate through the array from the end by decrementing the size variable and recursively calling the function searchElement(). 
If the size variable becomes less than zero it means the element is not present in the array and we return -1.
If a match is found, we return the size variable which is the index of the found element. This process is repeated until a value is returned to main().
