Instead of using array, we can also use linked list to implement stack. Linked list allocates the memory dynamically. 
However, time complexity in both the scenario is same for all the operations i.e. push, pop and display.
In linked list implementation of stack, the nodes are maintained non-contiguously in the memory. 
Each node contains a pointer to its immediate successor node in the stack. 
Stack is said to be overflown if the space left in the memory heap is not enough to create a node.
The top most node in the stack always contains null in its address field.
